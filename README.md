Follow-Focus
============
This project requiers an Arduino board, 2 Xbees, EasyDrive, Stepper motor and an Optical Encoder.
It is a Wireless Follow Focus system aimed at DSLR cameras.

The Moteino version is different obviously:
1/ Data protocol
2/ Speed management
3/ No Interrupts
4/ No Xbee (duh...)

Since the last change is from over a year ago I decided to fork this build and extend it as much as I am capable of.

More to come
